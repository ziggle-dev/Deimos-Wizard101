# Tutorial
## Instructions
1. Be sure all your clients are logged onto the desired wizard.
2. Run the ```Deimos.exe``` by double clicking it.

## Hotkeys
- Look in ```Deimos-config.ini``` to see what hotkeys are mapped.
- Any change to the config will require a restart of the tool.
- Refer to the discord server's reference channel for proper key names, they are case sensitive.

## Important
- Don't bug the community or myself for when updates are coming. This is a free tool and will stay that way.
- There's also more advanced features in the GUI that are difficult to explain in writing. Those are intended for more advanced users and/or script developers. No support will be provided on them.
- Additionally, minimal support will be provided on auto questing and auto sigil. This is highly generalized code by design and it is impossible to fix every issue or every circumstance.

## Other
The GUI also has a bot creator and flythrough creator. Information on these systems are in the bots/flythroughs channels of the Deimos discord server, or the [wiki](https://github.org/Deimos-Wizard101/Deimos-Wizard101/wiki).
